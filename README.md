# BoilerMake---PlotternotDrones-Hack

Using parrot drones to autonomously fly and be controlled via android app using an N64 Controller

BoilerMake hackathon 2015

11:30: started hacking 30 minutes ago, already spilled Orange Soda all over my keyboard and floor. Looks like I'm going to have a sticky keyboard.

12:00: Broke quadcopter blade.. uhh.. it came that way. Flies a little off. 

2:00: Drone has literally /no/ payload capacity, pivoting to something else, stay tuned.

2:06: Okay, ya making drone to be controlled via android app and through the N64 controller. Using the onboard IMU taking data for analysis and simulation.

2:30: Fuck it, we're making a 2D plotter *these are not hte drones you are looking for*

3:04: Doing forward/inverse kinematics, this hack is coming full circle

4:11: No stopping in sight, in fact we're not tired. Onwards with cutting cardboard!
